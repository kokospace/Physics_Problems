## 1. Vector Algebra

Given two vectors in 3D space: $\vec{a} = [2, 1, -3]$ and $\vec{b} = [4, -2, 1]$. Calculate:

a) The magnitude of each vector.

b) The dot product $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$.

c) The cross product $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$.

d) The angle between vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$.

### Solution 1 - fix bad formatting rendered by github!!!

a) The magnitude of a vector $\vec{v} = [v_x, v_y, v_z]$ is given by:
$$|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$$
For $\vec{a}$:
$$|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1 + 9} = \sqrt{14}$$
For $\vec{b}$:
$$|\vec{b}| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2 +
1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{21}$$
b) The dot product of two vectors $\vec{a} = [a_x, a_y, a_z]$ and $\vec{b} = [b_x, b_y, b_z]$ is calculated as:
$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z$$
For $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$:
$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = (2)(4) + (1)(-2) + (-3)(1) = 8 - 2 - 3 = 3$$
c) The cross product of two vectors $\vec{a} = [a_x, a_y, a_z]$ and $\vec{b} = [b_x, b_y, b_z]$ is calculated using the determinant of a matrix:
$$\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \begin{vmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
a_x & a_y & a_z \\
b_x & b_y & b_z
\end{vmatrix}$$
For $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$:
$$\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \begin{vmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
2 & 1 & -3 \\
4 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}$$
Calculating the determinant:
$$= \hat{i} (1 \cdot 1 - (-3)(-2)) - \hat{j} (2 \cdot 1 - (-3)(4)) + \hat{k} (2 \cdot (-2) - 1 \cdot 4)$$
$$= \hat{i} (1 - 6) - \hat{j} (2 + 12) + \hat{k} (-4 - 4)$$
$$= -5\hat{i} - 14\hat{j} - 8\hat{k}$$
d) The angle $\theta$ between two vectors can be found using the dot product and magnitudes:
$$\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|}$$
$$\cos \theta = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{21}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{294}}$$
$$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{294}}\right)= \arccos\left(\frac{3}{17.146}\right) \approx \arccos(0.175) \approx 80.1^\circ$$

## 2. Systems of Equations

Find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations: $2x + 3y = 12$ and $x - y = 1$.

### Solution 2

To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Here, we will use substitution.

From the second equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:

$$x = y + 1$$

Now substitute this into the first equation:

$$2(y + 1) + 3y = 12$$

Expand:

$$2y + 2 + 3y = 12$$

Combine like terms:

$$5y + 2 = 12$$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$$5y = 10$$

Divide by 5:

$$y = 2$$

Substitute back into $x = y + 1$:

$$x = 2 + 1 = 3$$

**Solution:** $x = 3, \quad y = 2$

## 3. Proportionality

Consider the Universal Law of Gravitation: $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $F$ is the gravitational force between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, $r$ is the distance between their centers, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. Determine the factor by which the force $F$ changes if the distance $r$ is *doubled* and both masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) are *halved*.

## 4. Rearranging Formulas

The formula for the period of a simple pendulum is $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$. Rearrange the equation give a formula for $g$ (acceleration due to gravity).

## 5. Trigonometry

A vector $\vec{A}$ has a magnitude of $15$ and makes an angle of $\theta = 60^\circ$ with the horizontal axis. Calculate its horizontal and vertical components.

## 6. Function Analysis

Consider the function $f(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 7$. Identify any local maxima or minima.

## 7. Logic & Series

A bicycle is 10 meters from a wall and moves towards it at a constant speed of $1\text{ m/s}$. A fly starts from the bicycle's front wheel and flies towards the wall at $2\text{ m/s}$. When it hits the wall, it instantly turns back and flies to the bicycle, and so on. What is the total distance the fly travels before being crushed?

## 8. Definite Integrals

Calculate the area under the curve of the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=\pi$.

## 9. Optimization Problem

A rectangle is under the curve $y = 3 - x^2$ in the first quadrant. What are the dimensions of the rectangle with the maximum area?

## 10. Infinite Series

Determine the final position of an ant that starts at the origin and moves according to the following pattern: 1 m east, 1/2 m north, 1/3 m west, 1/4 m south, 1/5 m east, and so on.
